# change-text-style-python
Makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal text and cursor positioning) work under MS Windows.

pyfiglet is a full port of FIGlet (http://www.figlet.org/) into pure
python. It takes ASCII text and renders it in ASCII art fonts (like
the title above, which is the 'block' font).
